# Prompt-Tuned Vision Transformers for Explainable Fine-Grained Recognition

### Student: Elbek Meliboev 220730

## Project Overview
This project explores **Prompt-Tuned Vision Transformers (ViTs)** for **fine-grained image recognition** tasks such as classifying bird species or flower types.  
By using lightweight **prompt tokens** instead of full model retraining, the system achieves strong accuracy with lower computational cost while maintaining **explainability** through attention visualization methods.
